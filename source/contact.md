==========

We welcome enquiries from those looking to join our friendly team or book us for an event.

New members of the team are always welcome – no experience of morris dancing is necessary as we have expert teachers on hand to guide you. We also welcome new musicians to the team and we have both male and female musicians.

We can be seen at a variety of events in Surrey, Hampshire and beyond and welcome booking enquiries – in addition to our regular pub nights we typically perform at fairs, fetes, festivals, community and corporate events. We are always happy to discuss potential bookings – we do have a full calendar though so please get in touch early if possible.

Contact secretary -at- jackstraws.org.uk or find us on Facebook.
