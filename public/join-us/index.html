    We run taster sessions every Autumn where you can learn a traditional
morris dance with our friendly team at the Hale Institute Hall in Upper
Hale, Farnham, GU9 0HN. If you want to join at other times of the year,
please contact us.

    In the summer we can be seen performing at fetes, festivals and
special events as well as our regular pub evenings where we dance with
other local groups. Our taster evenings are the perfect chance to give
morris dancing a try, dancing to live music in a supportive and fun
group. Dancing is a great form of exercise – and much more fun than the
gym. It’s also fantastic for your mental health and well-being. Loose
clothing and sports shoes recommended.

   <pre><code>    “I love Monday evenings … dancing makes me happy – it’s great exercise and a chance to learn something new with a great bunch of people. It’s really boosted my confidence.

    I never knew I was a dancer until I tried Morris.”</code></pre>

evenings.
