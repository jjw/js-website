    Jackstraws Morris
   </h1>
   <p>
    Welcome to the Jackstraws Morris website. We are a Cotswold Morris
side formed in 1977 and based in Farnham in Surrey, where we practice
from September to April.
   </p>
   <p>
    We perform dances from the Cotswold traditions of Fieldtown,
Adderbury, Ilmington and Upton-upon-Severn, and also some “in the
Cotswold tradition” developed by members of the side. We dance out in
the summer at fetes, festivals, local events and pubs, often with other
local teams. A quick scan through our programme will give you an idea of
the locations and types of event at which we perform. The latest news
can be found on our Facebook page.
   </p>
   <p>
    We can be booked to perform at fetes, fairs, weddings and other
celebrations, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> to find out more.
   </p>
   <p>
    We welcome new members and are always pleased to take enquiries from
people interested in joining the side, whether to dance or play music.
We practice on Monday evenings during the autumn/winter at the Hale
Institute Hall in Wings Road, GU9 0HN – contact us to find out about
joining our friendly team.
